Sometimes if you have multiple services and AWS is limiting the number of concurrent builds, it takes longer for your build to actually start.

You can check the build status by clicking on “Build Logs” in the Flightcontrol dashboard, then click on the “Phase Details” tab. There you can see which step of the build it’s currently stuck at.

If you suspect a concurrent build quote issue, [you can submit a quota increase request here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/codebuild/quotas/L-75822022).
