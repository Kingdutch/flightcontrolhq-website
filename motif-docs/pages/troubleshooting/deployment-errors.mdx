If the user is getting this error:

```
[
  [
    {
      "type": "FARGATE_DEPLOY_ERROR",
      "message": "Service could not reach steady state; rolled back to previuos version. Please check runtime logs."
    }
  ]
]
```

1. Go to the ECS service and under tasks see if there are stopped instances lately and what might be causing that in that instance log.
2. Check the events tab under the service for any errors
3. Check if the HealthCheck is not correct
