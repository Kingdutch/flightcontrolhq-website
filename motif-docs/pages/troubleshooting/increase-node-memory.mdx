title: Increase Node Memory - Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
---

If the user is getting this error during build or Runtime:

```
Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

1. This error means the Node application is running out of memory.
2. Add the following environment variable `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` which allocates 4GB of memory to the node process.
